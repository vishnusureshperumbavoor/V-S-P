              <h1 class="font-weight" style="font-size: 3rem">World in 2025</h1>
              Humans have enjoyed ruling the Earth for 300,000 years. However,
              for the first time since the Anthropocene epoch, humans have begun
              to worry about the rise of a new species—one that could become far
              more intelligent than humans: Artificial Intelligence. <br />
              Although AI has existed for over 60 years, the widespread concern
              began with the release of ChatGPT in December 2022. That moment
              marked a turning point, changing the world forever.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Initial frontier to Gen AI</h3>
              ChatGPT initiated the race to AGI with GPT-3, maintaining a
              leading position for a significant period until the emergence of
              Anthropic's Claude. They now face competition from xAI's Grok and
              Google's Gemini. However, none of these companies anticipated that
              an open-source model, DeepSeek, from China—a country with less
              computing power than the U.S.—would outperform all these models
              across a range of benchmarks.
              <br />
              Falcon and Mistral started the trend of open-sourcing model
              weights. However, both were significantly outperformed by Meta's
              Llama-3. Zuck has already announced Llama-4, set to release in
              2025. Meanwhile, Alibaba's Qwen is another promising model from
              China. Personally, I have used Qwen for its medical imaging
              capabilities, and it is truly impressive.
              <br />
              If I were ranking models based on my user experience, I would say:
              DeepSeek > Claude > ChatGPT.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Image Gen</h3>
              Even though DALL-E existed before the arrival of ChatGPT, people
              only began to marvel at AI-generated images after seeing the
              results of MidJourney. Now, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
              can generate images because they can be easily fine-tuned on
              frameworks like Stable Diffusion or FLUX.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Video Gen</h3>
              The tech world went berserk after seeing the demo of Sora in
              February 2024. However, as of December 2024, only the demo exists,
              and nothing has been officially released. Now, we have a lot of
              video-generation AIs, such as Kling (China), Runway ML, Pika Labs,
              and Luma (US). The impressive part is that open-source models like
              Mochi1 (US) and Hunyuan (China) are on par with the closed ones.
              Pepsi has already released an ad fully generated by AI, and I’ve
              created some good 30-second animated short films. I’m expecting
              fully AI-generated movies by 2025.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Speech, Music, Protein, SWE, RPA</h3>
              Generative AI is not limited to just text, image, and video—it
              also includes speech, music, and protein-generation models. I
              can't comment much on these areas since I haven't tried them out
              myself. However, there are significant concerns about the
              potential misuse of these technologies. For instance, scam calls
              using cloned voices, face morphing for malicious purposes, and
              generating fake videos of crimes someone never committed are
              becoming real threats. Unfortunately, low-literacy individuals are
              likely to be the most affected by these advancements, as they may
              struggle to discern real content from AI-generated fakes.
              <br />
              Another important aspect to consider is the potential replacement
              of software engineering jobs. So far, most software engineering
              (SWE) tools haven't posed a significant threat to human
              developers. AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are primarily
              saving developers time rather than replacing them. The much-hyped
              Devin, for instance, has been released with a hefty monthly cost
              of $500 (₹42,000), making it inaccessible for many organizations.
              This means junior developers are unlikely to be replaced anytime
              soon, as the cost and limitations of these tools still make human
              expertise indispensable.
              <br />
              Anthropic's computer agent and Microsoft's UI Parser might also
              replace Robotic Process Automation tools like UiPath.
              <h3 class="mt-2">AI Politics</h3>
              It’s hard to discuss anything related to technology without
              mentioning Elon Musk. As the race for AI supremacy heats up, Elon
              is at the forefront of it. He is known for having beef with a wide
              range of figures, including Zuck (Mark Zuckerberg), Jeff (Bezos),
              Yann LeCun, Soros, Biden, AOC, Bill Gates, Nicolás Maduro
              (President of Venezuela), Trudeau, Macron, and various groups such
              as the left wing, feminists, communists, and "woke" activists. He
              even allegedly influenced the U.S. election in favor of Donald
              Trump by manipulating X's algorithm to benefit Republicans. While
              YouTube and Instagram were seen as favoring Democrats, X countered
              this using Community Notes. Trump's election win has given Elon
              some leverage, especially amid his ongoing feud with Sam Altman.
              <br />
              Elon is triggered for not having a significant stake in OpenAI,
              while Sam is accused of spreading "evil" by advocating for global
              AI regulation. Elon, known for his transparency, open-sourced
              Twitter's algorithm and released the Twitter Files. However, he
              made the open-sourced Grok model less usable by releasing
              excessively large weights.
              <br />
              Initially openAI open sourced GPT-2 and Whisper (speech to text
              model). Now open source community is getting nothing from openAI.
              Sam Altman also trying to the sole leader in the space by
              promoting AI regulation around the world. European Union has fell
              into that trap. Europe is highly regulated that they made sure
              that no major players will come out of Europe.
              <br />
              The open AI board battle which started at the end of 2023 led to
              the collapse of the whole founding team. Ilya left to start SSI
              (Safe Super Intelligence). Mira Murati left. So Sam Altman has
              removed everyone who once defenestrated him from the company. Also
              Andrej Karpathy who once was the lead of Tesla Self driving left
              from there and joined OpenAI. He left from there also to start
              youtube channel.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Nobel Prize</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry was won by AI this year.
                Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopefield for their contribution to
                Neural Networks. Demis Hassabis (founder of Deepmind), John
                Jumper and David Baker for their contributions to the
                development of protein gen AI model.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">AI in Indian film industry</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                AI usage in Indian movies are increasing. Vijay de-ageing in
                GOAT, Vettaiyan movie Manassilaayo song used demised singer
                voice. You can also see Unni Mukundan's voice in tamil and
                telugu trailer of Marco is AI generated.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Deepseek</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Most important company which I'm looking for in the space of AI
                in 2025 is Deepseek. They have outperformed ChatGPT and Claude
                with less data training GPU power. Now Chinese model training
                capability is only going to increase. So we can expect more
                powerful open source models from deepseek. Also the APIs that
                they are offering is 10x cheaper than OpenAI.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">OpenAI</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                OpenAI has announced/released major things as a part of their 12
                days of Shipmas. o3 preview, sora, reinforcement finetuning, o1,
                preference finetuning etc.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Anthropic</h3>
              <p class="mt-4">
                So far anthropic's Claude is the best for coding.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Meta</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Meta changed the perspective of the big techs about AI around
                the world. They started the trend of open sourced highly capable
                models among the big techs. This is reflecting in their stock
                performing as well. Meta stock was falling after the failing of
                $10 billion project Metaverse. Now the open source community is
                waiting for the release of llama-4 in 2025.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Google</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Literally Google has mogged OpenAI's shipmas event by
                announcing/releasing lot of cool stuffs such as Veo2 (video gen
                model), Gemini2 (Proprietory LLM), PaliGemma2 (vision), Genie2
                (foundational world model), GenCast (weather predictor LLM),
                Alpha Qubit (Quandum Error Correction Model), Willow (Quandum
                Chip). The open source community is waiting for the release of
                Gemma3 in 2025.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">China</h3>
              The development of Chinese models Deepseek, Qwen (multimodal),
              Kling, Hunyuan (video gen) is impressive even though they had
              little GPU compute as compared to USA. So far no war escalation
              news is coming out related to China vs Taiwan. If TSMC from Taiwan
              goes into the hands of China then they can develop even much
              powerful models. Rumors also hearing that China is training their
              models using llama by Meta.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Nvidia</h3>
              Nvidia is becoming the sole leader by selling shovels in the AI
              gold rush. As the war is heating up Nvidia stock is only going to
              grow.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Power Generation methods for AI</h3>
              Sam Altman is invested in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion power
              generation startup. Majority of the electricity in the world will
              be used to train the models in the future. We need to gather more
              resources such as thermal, fission etc.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Major Things to look out for</h3>
