              <h1 class="font-weight" style="font-size: 3rem">World in 2025</h1>
              The humans were enjoying ruling the earth for 300,000 years. But
              for the first time since the anthropocene epoch, humans started
              worrying about the appraisal of a new species. A species which
              might become far more intelligent than humans - Artificial
              Intelligence. <br />
              Even though it was existed for more than 60 years back the worry
              started since the release of chatGPT in 2022 December. The world
              was changed for ever.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Text Generation Models</h3>
              <h4>Proprietary models</h4>
              ChatGPT started the race to AGI journey with GPT-3. After that
              Anthropic joined the race. Now google and Chinese model trying to
              catch up on these space. There are only 2 major players in the
              proprietary market. GPT-4 (OpenAI) and Claude (Anthropic). Gemini
              (Google) needs to catch up.
              <h4>Open Source models</h4>
              Falcon from UAE then Mistral from France started the trend of open
              sourcing the model. Then both are absolutely mogged by Llama-3
              (Meta). Now Zuck announced Llama-4 in 2025. But the thing is open
              source models stated getting competition from China also. Deepseek
              from China has a huge context length. Alibaba's Qwen is also
              catching up. Personally I have used Qwen for medical imaging
              capabilities and it is really good.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Image Generation Models</h3>
              Even though DallE was existed before the arrival of ChatGPT people
              started wondering at the generated images only after the arrival
              of MidJourney. But the wow factor started shading after the
              arrival of the video gen models. Now almost all major LLMs are
              multimodals and are capable to generate good images. Because of
              most of them are fine tuned on open sourced stable diffusion or
              flux.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Video Generation Models</h3>
              Video gen models will be the heated topic in AI in 2025. People
              wondered after seeing the demo of Sora in 2024 February. But as of
              2024 December only demo is there nothing is released from the side
              of OpenAI. We have witnessed lot of good videos generated by Kling
              (China), Runway ML, Pika Labs, Luma (US). Impressive part is the
              open sourced ones Mochi1 (US) and Hunyuan (China) are on par with
              the closed ones. Pepsi has released an ad fully generated by AI. I
              have good 30 seconds animated short films. I'm expecting to see a
              good realistic reels/short film in 2025 and a fully AI generated
              movie in 2026. 2025 will be the year of video gen models.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Others</h3>
              Gen AI is not only limited to just text, image and video. There
              are speech, music, protein gen models as well. I can't comment
              about anything of those bc I haven't tried out any. There are
              potential threat of rise of scam calls using people's voices.
              Anyone can morf your face into anything. Anyone can generate video
              of a crime that you haven't done. Low literate people are going to
              affect the most bc of these.
              <br />
              Another thing to look for is the replacement of software
              engineering jobs. So far most SWE tools are not a threat for the
              SWE humans. TOols such as chatgpt, claude, copilot, cursor is
              saving a lot of time of the developers. The much hyped Devin is
              released with $500 (â‚¹42000) monthly cost. Means junior developers
              are not gonna replace anytime soon.
              <br />
              Anthropic's computer agent might be also replacing Robotic Process
              Automation tools such as UiPath.
              <h3 class="mt-2">AI Politics</h3>
              How can we talk about anything related to technology without
              mentioning the name Elon Musk. As the race for AI supremacy is
              heating up Elon is in the for front of it. He is know for having
              the beef with Zuck, Jeff, Yann Lecun, Soros, Biden, AOC, Bill
              Gates, Nicolas Maduro (Venezuela President), Trudeau, Macron and
              the whole left wing, feminists, communists, wokes etc. He even
              made Trump win the US election by manipulating X algorithm in
              favor of Republicans. While Youtube and Instagram were favoring
              the Democrats, X countered it using the tool Community notes. The
              election win of Trump giving Elon some edge over others, as he is
              having some feud with Sam Altman related to the transparency and
              the company operation nature. Elon was in the board while OpenAI
              was started. Soon after OpenAI got a market fit product GPT-3 they
              started moved away from open source. Initially openAI open sourced
              GPT-2 and Whisper (speech to text model). Now open source
              community is getting nothing from openAI. Sam Altman also trying
              to the sole leader in the space by promoting AI regulation around
              the world. European Union has fell into that trap. Europe is
              highly regulated that they made sure that no major players will
              come out of Europe.
              <br />
              The open AI board battle which started at the end of 2023 led to
              the collapse of the whole founding team. Ilya left to start SSI
              (Safe Super Intelligence). Mira Murati left. So Sam Altman has
              removed everyone who once defenestrated him from the company. Also
              Andrej Karpathy who once was the lead of Tesla Self driving left
              from there and joined OpenAI. He left from there also to start
              youtube channel.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Nobel Prize</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry was won by AI this year.
                Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopefield for their contribution to
                Neural Networks. Demis Hassabis (founder of Deepmind), John
                Jumper and David Baker for their contributions to the
                development of protein gen AI model.

              <h3 class="mt-2">Meta</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Meta changed the perspective of the big techs about AI around
                the world. They started the trend of open sourced highly capable
                models among the big techs. This is reflecting in their stock
                performing as well. Meta stock was falling after the failing of
                $10 billion project Metaverse. Now the open source community is
                waiting for the release of llama-4 in 2025.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Google</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                Literally Google has mogged OpenAI's shipmas event by
                announcing/releasing lot of cool stuffs such as Veo2 (video gen
                model), Gemini2 (Proprietory LLM), PaliGemma2 (vision), Genie2
                (foundational world model), GenCast (weather predictor LLM),
                Alpha Qubit (Quandum Error Correction Model), Willow (Quandum
                Chip). The open source community is waiting for the release of
                Gemma3 in 2025.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">China</h3>
              The development of Chinese models Deepseek, Qwen (multimodal),
              Kling, Hunyuan (video gen) is impressive even though they had
              little GPU compute as compared to USA. So far no war escalation
              news is coming out related to China vs Taiwan. If TSMC from Taiwan
              goes into the hands of China then they can develop even much
              powerful models. Rumors also hearing that China is training their
              models using llama by Meta.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Nvidia</h3>
              Nvidia is becoming the sole leader by selling shovels in the AI
              gold rush. As the war is heating up Nvidia stock is only going to
              grow.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Power Generation methods for AI</h3>
              Sam Altman is invested in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion power
              generation startup. Majority of the electricity in the world will
              be used to train the models in the future. We need to gather more
              resources such as thermal, fission etc.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Major Things to look out for</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>AI generated movies/reels/short films</li>
                <li>AI SWEs real life demos</li>
                <li>
                  ML Model on the client as the model sizes are decreasing and
                  capabilities are increasing bc of WebGPU, Encoder-decoder
                  architecture & Web Workers etc.
