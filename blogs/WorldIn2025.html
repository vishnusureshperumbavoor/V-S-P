              <h1 class="font-weight" style="font-size: 3rem">World in 2025</h1>
              Humans have enjoyed ruling the Earth for 300,000 years. However,
              for the first time since the Anthropocene epoch, humans have begun
              to worry about the rise of a new species: AI. <br />
              Although AI has existed for over 60 years, the widespread concern
              began with the release of ChatGPT in December 2022. That moment
              marked a turning point, changing the world forever.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Initial frontier to Gen AI</h3>
              Currently there are 6 frontier models in the limelight. 1.GPT
              2.Deepseek 3.Claude 4.Grok 5.Llama 6.Gemini
              <br /><br />ChatGPT initiated the race to AGI with GPT-3. The
              closed source models GPT, Gemini, Claude & Grok were enjoying the
              American VC money untill the launch of deepseek-r1 on Trump's
              inauguration day. Even though Deepseek has released a bunch of
              other models before R1 this caught attention mainly because of the
              claimed model training cost. Only $5million. This was the time
              when Trump already announed $500 billion stargate project to
              domniate AGI. This broken US stock market especially Nvidia.
              <br />
              <br />
              Open source models trend went from Falcon --> Mistal --> Llama -->
              Deepseek. Now Mistral made a good comeback after the launch of Le
              Chat, their mobile app which has the highest inference speed for
              any LLM. They can answer upto 1000 words per second. Mistral is
              using chips from Cerebras, an American company which specifically
              builds chips for inference. Alibaba's Qwen is also another good OS
              model to look out for. <br /><br />Zuck announced that Meta is
              targeting for SOTA Llama4, AI SWE to contribute to RnD, to power
              this 2+ GW datacenter at Manhatten, bring online ~1GW power of
              compute and targeting 1.3 million GPUs in 2025.
              <br />
              Bank of China is planning to provice 1 trillion yuan ($137
              billion) in next 5 years to counter US's project Stargate.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Image Gen</h3>
              DallE, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, FLUX are the mojor terms in
              image generation. Grok, Gemini, Llama, Mistral can generate
              images. Currently Anthropic and Deepseek haven't relesed models
              with image gen capability.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Video Gen</h3>
              The tech world went berserk after seeing the demo of Sora in
              February 2024. However, as of December 2024, only the demo exists,
              and nothing has been officially released. Now, we have a lot of
              video-generation AIs, such as Kling (China), Runway ML, Pika Labs,
              and Luma (US).
              <br /><br />
              The impressive part is that open-source models like Mochi1 (US)
              and Hunyuan (China) are on par with the closed ones. Pepsi has
              already released an ad fully generated by AI, and I’ve created
              some good 30-second animated short films. I’m expecting fully
              AI-generated movies by 2025.
              <h3 class="mt-2">Speech, Music, Protein, SWE, RPA</h3>
              Generative AI is not limited to just text, image, and video—it
              also includes speech, music, and protein-generation models. I
              can't comment much on these areas since I haven't tried them out
              myself. However, there are significant concerns about the
              potential misuse of these technologies. For instance, scam calls
              using cloned voices, face morphing for malicious purposes, and
              generating fake videos of crimes someone never committed are
              becoming real threats. Unfortunately, low-literacy individuals are
              likely to be the most affected by these advancements, as they may
              struggle to discern real content from AI-generated fakes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another important aspect to consider is the potential replacement
              of software engineering jobs. So far, most software engineering
              (SWE) tools haven't posed a significant threat to human
              developers. AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are primarily
              saving developers time rather than replacing them. The much-hyped
              Devin, for instance, has been released with a hefty monthly cost
              of $500 (₹42,000), making it inaccessible for many organizations.
              This means junior developers are unlikely to be replaced anytime
              soon, as the cost and limitations of these tools still make human
              expertise indispensable.
              <br />
              <br />
              Anthropic's computer agent and Microsoft's UI Parser might also
              replace Robotic Process Automation tools like UiPath.
              <h3 class="mt-2">AI Politics</h3>
              China has joined for the rise for AGI with the launch of Deepseek
              R1. They are claiming they just used $5 million to train R1 while
              OpenAI used $20million to train o1. Lack of GPUs lead China to
              innovate in architectures.
              <br /><br />
              While it is sceptical that the feud between Elon and Sam will slow
              down the race in US. Elon is known for having beef with a wide
              range of figures, including entreprenuers such as Zuck (Mark
              Zuckerberg), Jeff (Bezos), Bill Gates, Yann LeCun, and left
              politicians Geroge Soros, Biden, AOC, Nicolás Maduro (President of
              Venezuela), Trudeau, and feminists, communists, and "woke"
              activists. He even allegedly involved in 2024 US election by
              manipulating X algorithm. While YouTube, Facebook and Instagram
              were favoring the woke gang, X countered this using Community
              Notes. Trump's election win has given Elon some leverage for his
              companies.
              <br />
              <br />
              Elon is triggered for not having a significant stake in OpenAI,
              while Sam is accused of spreading "evil" by advocating for global
              AI regulation. Elon is calling for OS even though what he done for
              OS is releasing an unusably big Grok model. It's looks like Elon
              doesn't want to live in a world where someone else making the
              world a better place than himself.
              <br />
              <br />
              Initially openAI open sourced GPT-2 and Whisper (speech to text
              model). Now open source community is getting nothing from openAI.
              Sam Altman also trying to the sole leader in the space by
              promoting AI regulation around the world. European Union has fell
              into that trap. Now things started to change after Trump's return.
              Mistral's Le Chat's launch is a good comeback by Europe.
              <br />
              <br />
              The open AI board battle which started at the end of 2023 led to
              the collapse of the whole founding team. Ilya left to start SSI
              (Safe Super Intelligence). Mira Murati left. So Sam Altman has
              removed everyone who once defenestrated him from the company. Also
              Andrej Karpathy who once was the lead of Tesla Self driving left
              from there and joined OpenAI. He left from there also to start
              youtube channel.
