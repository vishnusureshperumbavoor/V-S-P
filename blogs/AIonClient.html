              This is my series related to the implementation of AI on the
              client side. I will be covering WebGPU, ONNX and Encoder-Decoder
              models, transformers.js, WebWorkers etc.
              <h3 class="mt-2">WebGPU vs WebGL</h3>
              Both are browser rendering tools. WebGPU is the successor of WebGL
              which enables us to use Compute Shaders directly.
              <h3 class="mt-2">What is WebGL</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                WebGL is a javascript framework to render 2D and 3D graphics on
                your browser. Released in 2011. Almost all the graphics on the
                browsers are browsers are handled by WebGL. Most of the major
                web-based rendering frameworks such as three.js, babylon.js,
                box2D, cornerstone.js are written on top of WebGL. Until last
                few years "rendering on the web == WebGL".
                <br />
                WebGL is powered by Graphics API OpenGL.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Drawbacks of WebGL</h3>
              <p class="mt-4">
                The latest version of WebGL which is WebGL 2.0 is powered by
                OpenGL ES 3.0. It is came out in 2008. So basically the
                capabilities of WebGL is from a graphics API which is released
                16+ years back.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                There has been significant development in consumer level GPUs,
                starting with the GeForce 200 Series released in 2008. Since
                then, the series has progressed through the 300, 400, ..., 900,
                10 series, 20 series, and now the 40 series. Now we have
                graphics APIs such as DirectX 12, Vulkan, Metal etc. So using
                these graphics cards and graphics APIs there have been a huge
                development in the desktop/mobile games. But the browser games
                are still using WebGL which is still using OpenGL 3.0. So you
                can now imagine how behind is the web based rendering if you
                compare that with mobile/desktop based rendering. We have
                performance and frame rate issues on the web browsers. As since
                WebGL is till used OpenGL3.0 there are many functionalities of
                the SOTA graphic cards which we are not able to use on browsers.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">What is WebGPU</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                WebGPU is the successor of WebGL. It's development started in
                2017. It enabled us to use the latest graphics cards features.
                WebGPU is supported on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari etc.
                <br />
                WebGPU supports multi-threading which is helpful while
                downloading the model without using main thread.
                <br />
                WebGPU is powered by graphics APIs such as DirectX 12, Vulkan
                and Metal based on the browser platform.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">WebGPU for Machine Learning</h3>
              <p class="mb-3 mt-2">
                ML frameworks such as Tensorflow.js and Transformers.js are
                using WebGPU under the hood. If you want to do any kind of
                computations on the tensorflow, tensorflow has to convert the
                input tensor into textual or vertex data and again back to
                tensor data. WebGPU supports Compute Shader. Compute Shaders are
                General Purpose Programs that you can run on the GPUs. When
                tensorflow is directly able to use the computer shaders there is
                no need to convert the input data into vertex or textures. You
                can directly perform the computation on the shaders. Because of
                the less overhead it enabled the developers to run
                encoder-decoder ML models such as SAM2, Whisper, llama, gemma on
                the client side.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-2">
                Advantages of using ML model on the client side
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Gives privacy to the user data.</li>
                <li>
                  It enabled offline compute once the model is downloaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since no cloud is involved the latency will be lower once the
                  model is downloaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cost of running the model is zero since there are no OpenAI,
                  Anthropic or AWS API is involved.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="mt-2">Future</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As the device computing power increases more and almost all of
                  browsers supporting it, WebGPU usage is only going to grow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  WebGPU capabilities can increase the speed of medical imaging
                  platforms.
