                    <h5 class="mt-2">Venue : College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
                    <h5 class="mt-2">Result : Won 3rd prize</h5>
                    <p class="mb-3 mt-2">We won 3rd prize in this 36 hour event and was able to talk with h'ble agricultural minister of Kerala. 
                      VAIGA Agri Hack 23 is Kerala’s largest agricultural hackathon conducted as a part of the VAIGA Agricultural Fest, 
                      participating college students, startups, individuals, farmers, innovationists, and the public. <br><br>
                      Me & Afwan Sha came back from coimbatore paper presentation event & joined with our team. There were 5 members in 
                      our team including us and Rhithuja, Akhiyar, Shinas . They were already there on 24th. My price prediction were 
                      rejected by them one week back & now I joined Brown Plant Hopper detection problem statement. <br><br>

It was a 36 hour hackathon & the participants were not allowed to sleep between. Already it was sleepless nights for me last 2 days.

Our project was BPH detection using Low Powered Wide Area Network. Our product wasn't organized that much in the beginning. But it started 
to improve 
after each jury visit. I built 2 ML models based on eXtreme 
Gradient Boosting. After 36 hours both teams from our college selected to the final round.
After the presentation round, the winners were announced & we were third.
3rd in a state level hack is not bad. Right?? <br><br>

We received the price on March 2nd at Putharikandam Maidanam, Thiruvananthapuram.
We are also planning on upgrading the project into a startup.

                       Organized by the Department of IT&C, Rajasthan Hackathon 7.0 is a 24 hour non-stop 
                       coding marathon. The program started at 19/02/2023 10.00 PM & ended at 21/03/2023 10.00 AM. It was stupendous 
                       experience for me to participate in a national level cosmopolitan event. There were 3 members in my team including 
                       me, Afwan and Maheshwaran Mayavan from TN. It was 
                       first time I'm working with a member outside of the state. <br><br>

                       We were planning to do a tourist automation project based on smart city and infrastruture. But we didn't know 
                       they will give the problem statement 
                       only at 10.00 PM. There were total 12 problem statements. And we had doubt which problem to choose. I wanted to 
                       try supply chain management using blockchain. Maheshwaran wanted to try financial fraud detection. But to make it 
                       interesting we decided to do locust attack detection using LoRa sensor. 
                       
                       But what lacked was the hardware. We decided to give it a shot on the software part. We collected details related 
                       to the ideal condition for the existence of locust & created ML model on eXtreme Gradient Boosting. It was all 
                       perfectly fine. But what I understood from this hackathon was the IOT devices are the heart of every hackathons. <br><br>
                       
                       Rajasthan cold temperature was one hell of an experience for me. I thought rajasthan is a hot city before coming to 
                       this event. It was cold there even during afternoons. Made lot of friends from multiple cities like Pune, 
                       Chennai, Noida, Ahmedabad, Lucknow etc. The main agenda for participating in this event was to expand the network
                       all over India.

                      We won 1st prize in the startup idea pitching event. As always me and Afwan were the team members. Rijish Rajan 
                      (founder of Simplify Agri) who were the judge opened 
                      us an opportunity to build a company. He were searching for students like us. So this event leads to the phase 2 of my 
                      corporate career.<br><br> I was so excited to participate 
                      in this event, because the chief guests were Anoop K Ambike (CEO of KSUM),
                      Rahul Balachandran (founder & MD of Inker Robotics), Akhil Asokan (co-founder & COO of Sastra Robotics). Anoop K Ambika couldn't 
                      participate in the event.  Akhil Asokan managed the event very well. <br><br>
                      Also interacted with Shahid KP (co-founder and CEO of Koderfin) and lot of like minded people such as Mehara Jannath and Anjana and 
                      student from other collges as well. <br><br>
                      There were lot of ideas such as recycling of refined oil and creating biofuel out of moss. But the crop early disease detection
                      won the prize.

                      We won 2nd prize in this event. But the special thing was this event was the beginning of everything.
                      This was the foundation for Thiruvananthapuram, Rajasthan, Coimbatore, Palakkad and many more to come events. <br><br>

                      On 11/02/2023 this program's student coordinator invited us to participate in this event. Actually we didn't had any 
                      startup idea back then. But we had a project which we prepared for an hackathon event at Thiruvananthapuram. 
                      So we decided showcase that project as a startup idea. I called Afwan Sha he was ready to join with me.
                      
                      It was an idea related to agricultural market intelligence. We created a ML model based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting to 
                      predict the prices and yield of crops and a crop recommendation system. 
                      <br><br>
                      We presented the idea first. Cuz others were not ready to present. Funny part is that the judges are co-founders of Infinio
                      Technology Solutions (The company which is I'm doing internship). Everything was good except we failed to answer a question related to the GDP 
                      contribution of agricultural sector to Indian economy. It was only 16%. But we said 50%.

                      This National level technical symposium was a special event for me. Becuase I met Maheshwaran Mayavan who won the 
                      1st prize in this event. He is 
                      a 17 year old develper and public speaker from Tamil 
                      Nadu. We discussed a lot about current technolgies. Also he is the one who compelled us to participate in the 
                      Rajastan IT Hackathon which happened after 23 days of this event. 
                      <br><br>
                      We didn't won any prize cuz the program was actually paper presentation, but 
                      actually what we presented is startup idea presentation. Real time applications using AI/ML and Big Data Analytics
                      were the subjects. What I thought is we should build projects based on these subjects and present it. And a guy who
                      read 'What is Machine Learning' won the 2nd prize. 

                      We reached at Coimbatore on 23/02/2023 10.30 PM and was all set for the program. There were contestants from 
                      Karnataka & Tamil Nadu. We were the only one from Kerala though. Program started at morning 9.30.

We presentation was the rejected Vaiga Agrihack 2023 Agricultual Price Prediction project. Our ML model using eXtreme gradient boosting 
can predict the prices and yield of agricultural crops. We removed the crop recommendation model to purely focus on regression analysis 
instead of classification.
<br><br>
The judges were talking about the practical application of ML and we presented the same. Even though we didn't get any prize.

Moreover it was really nice to participate in a national level event. This program was really helpful to check my English speaking skills.

We left from there to participate in Trivandrum event. Our project were rejected by the organizers on 17/02/2023 & we joined another 
team. I'm hopping that we will win the prize on 27/02/2023. It's a 3 day event & 36 hour hackathon.

                      We started preparation for this event about a month ago and my speech wasn't that much great. But this event helped 
                      me to overcome the stage fear. I alreay took 3 seminars in my college to get rid of my stage fear. But this big 
                      event at BMC was real test. The speech statement was 
                      'College hostels need time limit'. I got to speak in favor of the statement. I couldn't speak well actually I was 
                      against it. Fathima Sulaiman's and Fayiz KV's speech was top notch. We were well guided by our college faculties
                      Salih K sir and Soya Narayanan Ma'am and Principal Aiju Thomas.
                      <br><br>
Fathima Sulaiman selected to next round.
